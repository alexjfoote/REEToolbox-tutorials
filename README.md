# REEToolbox-tutorials
A repository containing tutorial notebooks for the Robustness Evaluation and Enhancement Toolbox (https://github.com/alexjfoote/REEToolbox), along with the models and data necessary to run them.

To use these tutorials you need to clone this repo to your desired location. The easiest option is to clone it to a Google Drive directory and use Google Colab to run the notebooks. Colab has all the dependencies of the toolbox installed and has free GPUs available, making it an easy way to get started quickly.

You can also clone the repo locally, create a virtual environment within the directory, run `pip install reetoolbox` to install the toolbox and its dependencies, then run the tutorial notebooks with Jupyter notebooks.
